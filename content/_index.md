### Ready to find your new matrix home?
Our unofficial **matrix public server list** is intended to help people to find and choose their servers to connect to. And helping maintainers to find their users and build their community. Maintainers can add their servers by adding an issue to our [Github repository](https://github.com/Atreatis/matrixservers) and filling in the information. Our server list is not heavily curated to be added to the list more information can be found bellow.

**Requirements:**  
- The server must follow the [Code of Conduct](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/code_of_conduct.html) by [matrix.org](https://matrix.org)  
- The server must be compliant to acceptable laws.  
- The server must be actively maintained.  
- The server must be stable and in production.  
- Create an issue with the [Add server](https://github.com/Atreatis/matrixservers/issues/new?assignees=Atreatis&labels=&template=add-server.md&title=%5BADD%5D) issue template.

### What is Matrix?
Matrix is a decentralized and privacy aware network where you can chat and interact with others. Your communication will always be send through peer to peer encryption. Optionally you can even encrypt your entire chat history with individual conversations or channels. Whenever you are chatting through the Matrix network you will be assured that privacy is done right.

Currently the majority of the members base is on the largest server called [matrix.org](https://matrix.org/). And everyday there are more new servers coming online within the network. Unfortunately there isn't an "official" of servers or instances where people can connect to. Because there isn't a real [list](https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/6827) we've started creating a [server list](/servers) our own. Since we want to work on decentralization of the network and support other maintainers and the users to have a mode decentralized network.

### Host your own Matrix Server
You can host your own matrix server from a VPS or even from home (not advisable)  your home server should always online. Matrix is an open source and everyone can join the federated network [official repository](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse). And do not forget to [add your server](https://github.com/Atreatis/matrixservers/issues/new?assignees=Atreatis&labels=&template=add-server.md&title=%5BADD%5D) at matrixservers.net.
